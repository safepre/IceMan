# IceMan (DigDug Knockoff)
## General info
The project is a knockoff of the classic game "Dig Dug" built using C++ programming concepts, including raw pointers and object-oriented programming principles such as polymorphism, inheritance, and composition. The breadth-first search algorithm was also utilized. The framework of code was provided by an instructor and the project involved assembling and compiling various components, such as images, audio, animation, and a map with boundaries to prevent objects from going out of bounds. This project showcased the use of C++ programming skills and problem-solving abilities to bring the game to life.
